## Overview
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD. This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application.
In this project a web-based application was given that reads RSS feeds. The project task was to complete a set of tests using Jasmine.
For example:
- Test Suite "The Menu" 
- Test Suite "Initial Entries"
- Test Suite "New Feed Selection"
